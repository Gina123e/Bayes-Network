# Bayes-Network
+ This is the homework of data mining ,bioinformatics in HUST.
### 1.What's bayes rule?
$p(A|B)=\frac{p(B|A)p(A)}{p(B)}$
### 2.Algorithms I have used.
Predict the donor(acceptor) sites using Bayes Network
We have serval algorithms to predict the structure of gene,such as WMM,WMM,HMM,Bayes Network,SVM,ANN.This respority is associated with Bayes Network containing the code and the results.
